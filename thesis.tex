\acknowledgements

I would first like to acknowledge my supervisor, Professor Vincenzo Della Mea, for his support and his willingness during my thesis work.

I would also like to express my gratitude to Professor Stefano Fabris from the University of Udine and Jana Schlicksupp from Movisens GmbH, along with all the other people who have contributed to the realisation of this work.

I also wish to thank my fellows Francesco, Lorenzo, Gabriele, Massimiliano and Alessandro, with whom I have had the privilege of sharing the undergraduate experience with enthusiasm and passion.
