In order to define a common ground for the reader, this chapter introduces the main contents on which this work is based. For this purpose, a brief introduction about the current \textbf{state of knowledge} in terms of fall detection and the role of the \textbf{Electrodermal Activity} is proposed. Additionally, the concept of \textbf{Wearable Device} is briefly introduced.

In the field of research, a fall is described as an \textbf{unpredicted event} leading a subject to rest on the floor level~\cite{Lamb1}. On that basis, the activity of Fall Detection has referred over the years to the identification of a fall through cameras and sensors in order to request assistance.
