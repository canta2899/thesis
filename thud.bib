    abstract = {The prevention of injury associated with falls in older people
                is a public health target in many countries around the world.
                Although there is good evidence that interventions such as
                multifactorial fall prevention and individually prescribed
                exercise are effective in reducing falls, the effect on serious
                injury rates is unclear.1,2 Historically, trials have not been
                adequately powered to detect injury endpoints, and variations in
                case definition across trials have hindered meta-analysis.1 It is
                possible that fall-prevention strategies have limited effect on
                falls that result in injuries or are ineffective in populations
                who are at a higher risk of injury. Further research is required
                to determine whether fall-prevention interventions can reduce
                serious injuries. Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFaNE) is
                a collaborative project to reduce the burden of fall injury in
                older people through excellence in research and promotion of best
                practice (http://www.profane.eu.org). The European Commission
                funds the network, which links clinicians, members of the public,
                and researchers worldwide. The aims are to identify major gaps in
                knowledge in fall injury prevention and to facilitate the
                collaboration necessary for large-scale clinical research
                activity, including clinical trials, comparative research, and
                prospective meta-analysis. Work is being undertaken in a 4-year
                program. As a first step, the development of a common set of
                outcome definitions and measures for future trials or
                meta-analysis was considered.},
