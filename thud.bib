                is a public health target in many countries around the world.
                Although there is good evidence that interventions such as
                multifactorial fall prevention and individually prescribed
                exercise are effective in reducing falls, the effect on serious
                injury rates is unclear.1,2 Historically, trials have not been
                adequately powered to detect injury endpoints, and variations in
                case definition across trials have hindered meta-analysis.1 It is
                possible that fall-prevention strategies have limited effect on
                falls that result in injuries or are ineffective in populations
                who are at a higher risk of injury. Further research is required
                to determine whether fall-prevention interventions can reduce
                serious injuries. Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFaNE) is
                a collaborative project to reduce the burden of fall injury in
                older people through excellence in research and promotion of best
                practice (http://www.profane.eu.org). The European Commission
                funds the network, which links clinicians, members of the public,
                and researchers worldwide. The aims are to identify major gaps in
                knowledge in fall injury prevention and to facilitate the
                collaboration necessary for large-scale clinical research
                activity, including clinical trials, comparative research, and
                prospective meta-analysis. Work is being undertaken in a 4-year
                program. As a first step, the development of a common set of
                outcome definitions and measures for future trials or
                meta-analysis was considered.},

    abstract = {Falling is among the most damaging event elderly people may
                experience. With the ever-growing aging population, there is an
                urgent need for the development of fall detection systems. Thanks
                to the rapid development of sensor networks and the Internet of
                Things (IoT), human-computer interaction using sensor fusion has
                been regarded as an effective method to address the problem of
                fall detection. In this paper, we provide a literature survey of
                work conducted on elderly fall detection using sensor networks
                and IoT. Although there are various existing studies which focus
                on the fall detection with individual sensors, such as wearable
                ones and depth cameras, the performance of these systems are
                still not satisfying as they suffer mostly from high false
                alarms. Literature shows that fusing the signals of different
                sensors could result in higher accuracy and lower false alarms,
                while improving the robustness of such systems. We approach this
                survey from different perspectives, including data collection,
                data transmission, sensor fusion, data analysis, security, and
                privacy. We also review the benchmark data sets available that
                have been used to quantify the performance of the proposed
                methods. The survey is meant to provide researchers in the field
                of elderly fall detection using sensor networks with a summary of
                progress achieved up to date and to identify areas where further
                effort would be beneficial.},

    abstract = {When divers are at depth in water, the high pressure and low
                temperature alone can cause severe stress, challenging the human
                physiological control systems. The addition of cognitive stress,
                for example during a military mission, exacerbates the challenge.
                In these conditions, humans are more susceptible to autonomic
                imbalance. Reliable tools for the assessment of the autonomic
                nervous system (ANS) could be used as indicators of the relative
                degree of stress a diver is experiencing, which could reveal
                heightened risk during a mission. Electrodermal activity (EDA), a
                measure of the changes in conductance at the skin surface due to
                sweat production, is considered a promising alternative for the
                non-invasive assessment of sympathetic control of the ANS. EDA is
                sensitive to stress of many kinds. Therefore, as a first step, we
                tested the sensitivity of EDA, in the time and frequency domains,
                specifically to cognitive stress during water immersion of the
                subject (albeit with their measurement finger dry for safety).
                The data from 14 volunteer subjects were used from the
                experiment. After a 4-min adjustment and baseline period after
                being immersed in water, subjects underwent the Stroop task,
                which is known to induce cognitive stress. The time-domain
                indices of EDA, skin conductance level (SCL) and non-specific
                skin conductance responses (NS.SCRs), did not change during
                cognitive stress, compared to baseline measurements.
                Frequency-domain indices of EDA, EDASymp (based on power spectral
                analysis) and TVSymp (based on time-frequency analysis), did
                significantly change during cognitive stress. This leads to the
                conclusion that EDA, assessed by spectral analysis, is sensitive
                to cognitive stress in water-immersed subjects, and can
                potentially be used to detect cognitive stress in divers.},

                recent years, the term “data” has experienced a major
                rejuvenation in many aspects of our lives. The rapid development
                of the Internet and web technologies allows ordinary users to
                generate vast amounts of data about their daily lives. On the
                Internet of Things, the number of connected devices has grown
                exponentially; each of these produces real-time or near real-time

                processed, and analyzed with conventional computing methodologies
                and resources, is referred to as the “Big Data.” In this chapter,
                we focus on a subset of big data: digital data and analog data.
                These two major subsets are further divided as the environmental
                and personal source of data. We have also highlighted the data
                types and formats as well as different input mechanisms. These
                classifications are helpful to understand the active and passive
                way of data collection and production with explicit and without (
                i.e., implicit) human involvement. This chapter intends to
                provide enough information to support the reader to understand
                the role of digital and analog sources, and how data is acquired,
