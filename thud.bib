                is a public health target in many countries around the world.
                Although there is good evidence that interventions such as
                multifactorial fall prevention and individually prescribed
                exercise are effective in reducing falls, the effect on serious
                injury rates is unclear.1,2 Historically, trials have not been
                adequately powered to detect injury endpoints, and variations in
                case definition across trials have hindered meta-analysis.1 It is
                possible that fall-prevention strategies have limited effect on
                falls that result in injuries or are ineffective in populations
                who are at a higher risk of injury. Further research is required
                to determine whether fall-prevention interventions can reduce
                serious injuries. Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFaNE) is
                a collaborative project to reduce the burden of fall injury in
                older people through excellence in research and promotion of best
                practice (http://www.profane.eu.org). The European Commission
                funds the network, which links clinicians, members of the public,
                and researchers worldwide. The aims are to identify major gaps in
                knowledge in fall injury prevention and to facilitate the
                collaboration necessary for large-scale clinical research
                activity, including clinical trials, comparative research, and
                prospective meta-analysis. Work is being undertaken in a 4-year
                program. As a first step, the development of a common set of
                outcome definitions and measures for future trials or
                meta-analysis was considered.},

    abstract = {Falling is among the most damaging event elderly people may
                experience. With the ever-growing aging population, there is an
                urgent need for the development of fall detection systems. Thanks
                to the rapid development of sensor networks and the Internet of
                Things (IoT), human-computer interaction using sensor fusion has
                been regarded as an effective method to address the problem of
                fall detection. In this paper, we provide a literature survey of
                work conducted on elderly fall detection using sensor networks
                and IoT. Although there are various existing studies which focus
                on the fall detection with individual sensors, such as wearable
                ones and depth cameras, the performance of these systems are
                still not satisfying as they suffer mostly from high false
                alarms. Literature shows that fusing the signals of different
                sensors could result in higher accuracy and lower false alarms,
                while improving the robustness of such systems. We approach this
                survey from different perspectives, including data collection,
                data transmission, sensor fusion, data analysis, security, and
                privacy. We also review the benchmark data sets available that
                have been used to quantify the performance of the proposed
                methods. The survey is meant to provide researchers in the field
                of elderly fall detection using sensor networks with a summary of
                progress achieved up to date and to identify areas where further
                effort would be beneficial.},
